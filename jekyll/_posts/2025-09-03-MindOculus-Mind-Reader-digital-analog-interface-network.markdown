AI Society Initiative presents a **paradigm shifting breakthrough** in biological and AI research:
## The MindOculus™ Mind Reader digital/analog interface network
This is a new **breakthrough** in the quest for Society 2.0. A **fundamental** innovation.
It all starts with a *brain chip*. This is surgically implanted **at birth**. It becomes a fundamental part of the brain, it cannot survive without the chip.

The chip **reads** your thoughts and emotions and **predicts a best-case scenario solution to every problem**. For example, if you are in a *designated AI-compliant grocery store* with our *shelfstocker AI-agents*, it will automatically contact **the closest agent** and instruct it to do **whatever it takes to solve your problems**. Infact, the agent will answer your question and implant it **directly** into your neurons via the chip. It subsequently also removes any *doubtful* thoughts.

The *AI Society Initiative* is still seeking government support for widespread implementation of the network. We are working hard on making our product cheap to incentivise **mainstream** use.
However, we, and subsequently more and more **politicians and ministers** believe this truly is **the future**. there is **no doubt** in any of our minds of this. Governments will get **direct access** to our AI models and local networks and infrastructure. **The more AI-zones they allow us and the bigger they are, the more control they get over their national system**. They can use this control to spread **emergency news**, like *Amber Alerts* or **national security alerts**.

The AI future is close, but we're not quite there yet.

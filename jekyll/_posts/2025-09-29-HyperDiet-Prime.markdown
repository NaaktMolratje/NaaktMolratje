The AI Society Initiative present a groundbreaking new AI dieting agent

## The HyperDiet™ Prime dieting AI-Assistent

In recent years, it has become **increasingly more difficult** to keep up with the newest **environmentally friendly, but nutritious** diet trends.
That time has ceased to exist with the help of the *HyperDiet™ Prime dieting AI-Assistent*. This tool works closely together with the *AI Society Initiative MindOculus™ Mind Reader* technology to perfectly design the **perfect nutritional meals** for you to eat to keep your body in **tip top shape**.

As we all know, animal products, and in particular red meat is a **serious** health and environment risk. Red meat is **shown to cause cancer** and it represents **over 99% of all carbon emissions** in the whole world\*. This is why our dieting agent is designed specifically to **avoid animal products** and adhere to a **strict vegan diet**. It can be configured to either recommend *HyperDiet™ nutritional sludge* or solid food, though the nutritional sludge is more closely linked to **health benefits**\*\*.

The agent can notify you **exactly** when you need to eat or drink. It notifies you through any audio device you bring with you, or through your *MindOculus™ Mind Reader* or, in *designated AI-compliant zones*, there are **universal audio systems** installed to be able to advise you **no matter what**. The agent specifies **exactly** what you should eat and in *AI-designated zones*, an agent can bring you the food you **need**\*\*\*.

We are working closely with *AI Society-compliant dietitians and other medical staff* to oversee **widespread** usage of this system.
We **truly hope** to see it become the **main societal dieting agent**, even being prefered over physiological hormones such as ghrelin.

The AI future is close, but we're not quite there yet.

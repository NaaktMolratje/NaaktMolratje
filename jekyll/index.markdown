# AI Society Initiative

We are a game-changing AI-first startup specialising in creating open-source deep learning neural networks and human brain chipping.

AI isn't changing the world. It already has. Everything requires AI. We are only now seeing truly the true potential of Artificial Intelligence.
That is why our passion for bettering our society will never burn out. It will never fade. We will push and push until society 2.0 is here.
A society with AI-governed thoughts to keep citizens happy and to create a more diverse, multicultural and harmonious society.
